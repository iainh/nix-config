# ABOUTME: Takes advantage of Determinate Nix features for better performance

  # All nix.* options disabled when using Determinate Nix with nix.enable = false
  # Determinate Nix manages its own configuration and daemon
  # 
  # For Determinate Nix configuration, use:
  # - ~/.config/nix/nix.conf for user settings
  # - /etc/nix/nix.conf for system settings (managed by Determinate)
  # 
  # Common optimizations that were here:
  # - max-jobs = auto
  # - cores = 0 (use all cores)
  # - trusted-substituters including FlakeHub and Determinate caches
  # - Various performance and timeout settings
  # 
  # These should be configured directly via Determinate Nix tools or nix.conf
